### Why TermWise?
Most people blindly accept terms and conditions without reading them. This is understandable - legal documents are deliberately complex and time-consuming to read. TermWise bridges this gap by giving you the critical information you need to make informed decisions about the agreements you enter online.

### Privacy & Security
• TermWise only processes document text when you explicitly activate it
• Your data is only sent to AI providers for processing the current document
• No permanent storage of analyzed documents or conversations
• Use your own API keys for complete control (optional)

### Who Needs TermWise?
• Everyone who uses online services and accepts terms without reading them
• Privacy-conscious users who want to know what they're agreeing to
• Busy professionals who don't have time to read lengthy legal documents
• Anyone concerned about their digital rights

TermWise isn't a replacement for professional legal advice, but it helps you identify when such advice might be needed.
