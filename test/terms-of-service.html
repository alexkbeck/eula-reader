        <h2>9. Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver</h2>
        <p>For any dispute you have with TechGadget, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute informally. If TechGadget has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy by binding arbitration, rather than in court.</p>
        <p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
        <p>YOU AND TECHGADGET AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
