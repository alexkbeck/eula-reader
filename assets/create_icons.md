# Creating Icon Files for EULA Reader Extension

You'll need to create the following icon files in PNG format for the extension:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon24.png` (24x24 pixels)
- `icon32.png` (32x32 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

These icons should be created to match the Material Design guidelines. The icon should visually represent the EULA Reader functionality, such as:

- A document with a magnifying glass
- A document with a simplified/summarized view
- A legal document with a friendly interpretation

Consider using a color scheme that matches the extension's blue theme (#1976d2).

## Temporary Icon Creation

Until you have final icons, you can use placeholder generators or simple solid-colored squares as placeholders:

1. For solid placeholders, create square images in the required dimensions with the color #1976d2
2. Add a simple white symbol (like a document or text) in the center

## Tools for Creating Icons

- Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop
- Figma
- Sketch
- Online icon generators (like favicon.io)

Remember to create each icon at the exact pixel dimensions required, and save them in PNG format with transparency.
